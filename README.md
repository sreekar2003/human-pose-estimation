**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates real-time human pose estimation using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system processes video input (either from a file or a webcam) to detect human body landmarks and visualize the skeletal structure. It serves as a foundation for applications in fitness tracking, interactive systems, and augmented reality.

**Contribution**

This project is part of the TechSaksham Internship Program and is submitted as an internship contribution. It showcases practical implementation skills in computer vision and real-time pose estimation.

**Features**
	•	Real-time Pose Estimation: Detects human poses from live video feeds or pre-recorded videos.
	•	MediaPipe Integration: Utilizes MediaPipe’s Pose solution for accurate landmark detection.
	•	OpenCV for Visualization: Displays the processed frames with pose landmarks and connections drawn on them.
	•	Flexible Input: Supports both video files and live webcam input for pose detection.

**Technologies Used**
	•	Python: Main programming language.
	•	OpenCV: For image and video processing.
	•	MediaPipe: For pose detection and landmark estimation.
