_**Human Pose Estimation using Computer Vision**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on Human Pose Estimation using computer vision techniques. The system detects and analyzes human body joints and predicts body posture in real time. The project utilizes deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in detecting various poses and is aimed at applications such as fitness tracking, augmented reality, and interactive gaming.

**Contribution**

This project is a part of the TechSaksham Internship Program and represents a culmination of the skills and knowledge gained during the internship. The code and methodologies implemented are designed to contribute to the broader community interested in computer vision and pose estimation research.

**Features**
	•	Real-time Pose Estimation: Detects and visualizes human poses in real time using video input.
	•	Multiple Pose Detection: Capable of detecting multiple people and their respective poses in a single frame.
	•	Pre-trained Deep Learning Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as OpenPose, PoseNet, or HRNet for efficient and accurate pose estimation.
	•	Customizable Visualization: Provides options for visualizing detected joints and skeletal structure over the input images or video feed.
